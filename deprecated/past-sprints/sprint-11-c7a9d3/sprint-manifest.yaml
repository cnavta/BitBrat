source_of_truth: architecture.yaml
objective: "Advanced URL Map YAML Generation + Import Mechanics"
scope:
  - URL map YAML generator from architecture.yaml (hostRules, pathMatchers, routeRules, weighted backends)
  - Guarded import flow: describe → diff → conditional import via gcloud
  - Terraform URL map stub with lifecycle ignore_changes
  - brat CLI wiring to run import post-apply; dry-run safe

acceptance_criteria:
  - Dev/staging URL maps imported; describe matches desired YAML; diffs clean in CI
  - Guarded import implemented and idempotent (no-op when no drift)
  - Terraform lifecycle ignore_changes applied to URL map stub
  - Unit tests for renderer with fixtures; integration import test for non-prod
dependencies:
  - "Sprint 9 LB stack in place with backend services"
validation:
  root_validate_script: validate_deliverable.sh

definition_of_done:
  - Planning artifacts complete and validated
  - Tests for any new code introduced during the sprint
  - Deployment scripts are safe to run in dry-run
  - Documentation updated and linked from planning/index.md
