## Entry 1
- Prompt-ID: start-sprint-98-2025-11-20
- User Prompt (summary): "We are starting a new sprint. Attached is the documentation for the sprint. Please complete it."
- Agent Interpretation:
  - Start a new sprint per Sprint Protocol (S1–S4). Initialize required planning artifacts only; do not modify runtime code.
  - Use architecture.yaml as canonical. Build on prior Sprint 97 Event Bus documentation for continuity.
- Actions Taken:
  - Created planning/sprint-98-b4d92e/sprint-manifest.yaml
  - Created planning/sprint-98-b4d92e/implementation-plan.md
  - Created planning/sprint-98-b4d92e/request-log.md (this file)
  - Added planning/sprint-98-b4d92e/validate_deliverable.sh (to be executed for validation)
- Next Steps:
  - Seek Lead Architect approval of implementation-plan.md
  - Upon approval, prepare PR: branch feature/sprint-98-b4d92e, PR title "Sprint 98 Deliverables — Phase 1 Event Bus (Docs)"
