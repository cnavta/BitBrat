## Completed as Implemented
- [x] Sprint folder initialized with required artifacts:
  - sprint-manifest.yaml (now marked completed)
  - implementation-plan.md
  - request-log.md
  - validate_deliverable.sh
- [x] Validation executed: planning/sprint-98-b4d92e/validate_deliverable.sh → PASS
- [x] Closure docs created:
  - verification-report.md (this file)
  - retro.md
  - key-learnings.md
  - publication.yaml (PR metadata prepared)

## Partial or Mock Implementations
- [ ] Publication PR: Prepared but not created from this environment.
  - publication.yaml captures intended branch and PR title per Sprint Protocol.
  - Next human step: push branch feature/sprint-98-b4d92e and open PR.

## Additional Observations
- All artifacts explicitly reference architecture.yaml as the source of truth.
- Scope was documentation-only; no runtime code or deployment changes introduced.
- Validation script asserts key plan sections and cross-references to Sprint 97 docs.

## Validation Summary
```
Result: PASS — required files present; architecture.yaml found; plan sections present; references verified.
```
