# Sprint 10 Retro — sprint-10-ae91d4

Date: 2025-11-14

## What went well
- Delivered CDKTF connectors synth with clean outputs and README guidance.
- Implemented brat preflight enforcement (describe-only) with CI guardrails; comprehensive unit tests.
- CI pipelines updated to include connectors dry-run planning alongside network and lb.
- All tests passed; local validation and check.sh stayed green without regressions.

## What could be improved
- Earlier integration of connectors apply evidence into the sprint timeline to avoid end-of-sprint deferral.
- Automate PR creation/update to satisfy Sprint Protocol publication requirements consistently.

## Action items
- Capture dev apply evidence for connectors outside CI and attach to planning/sprint-10-ae91d4/local-apply-evidence.md.
- Open a PR for feature/sprint-10-ae91d4 with links to execution and verification docs; request review.
- Evaluate adding a custom Cloud Build image that includes Terraform to stabilize infra plan steps.

## Notes
- Sprint closed per directive “Sprint complete.” Remaining operational follow-ups are tracked as carry-forwards.
