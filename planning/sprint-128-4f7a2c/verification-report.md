Deliverable Verification – sprint-128-4f7a2c

Completed
- Technical Architecture for modular LLM personality injection
- Implementation plan (planning phase, no code yet)
- Sprint scaffolding (manifest, request log, validation wrapper)

Partial
- Publication (PR creation pending implementation changes)

Deferred
- Implementation of llm-bot personality resolver and composer (awaiting plan approval)
- Tests (unit/integration) for personality features

Alignment Notes
- Follows architecture.yaml precedence; feature-flagged behavior ensures backward compatibility.
- Data model includes /personalities with status for activation control.
