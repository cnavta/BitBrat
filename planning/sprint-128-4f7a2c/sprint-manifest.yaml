title: "Modular LLM Personality Architecture"
goal: |
  Define a modular, annotation-driven mechanism for injecting dynamic personalities into the llm-bot system prompt.
  Personalities are resolved from Firestore (/personalities) by ID or provided inline via event annotations, enabling
  rule-based, contextual behavior with robust caching, observability, and safe fallbacks.
