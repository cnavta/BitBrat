# Retro – sprint-248-b1c2d3

## What Worked
- Reusing the validation script from the previous sprint saved time.
- The feedback to remove the `event-router` from Egress simplified the flow significantly.
- Categorizing routing rules by phase provides a clear path for reducing boilerplate in the implementation phase.

## What Didn't Work
- N/A

## Improvements for Next Sprint
- As we move into implementation, ensure the `event-router`'s rule engine supports phase-based rule loading.
