# Retro – sprint-191-a7d2e3

## What worked
- Quick identification of the compilation error source (merge conflict).
- Restoring MCP handlers to registration methods correctly satisfied existing tests.
- Comprehensive project analysis provided a clear roadmap for open-sourcing.
- `validate_deliverable.sh` provided a reliable way to verify the project state.
- Standard documentation templates (MIT, Contributor Covenant) facilitated rapid creation of open-source files.
- Adding early development warnings ensures transparency with potential users and contributors.

## What didn’t
- The initial task had a severe syntax error that could have been avoided with better merge practices.
- The project was completely missing standard open-source files, creating a high initial barrier for public involvement.

## Next time
- Ensure all merge conflicts are resolved carefully and tests are run locally before pushing to main.
- Continue executing the open-source preparation backlog, starting with environment standardization (OS-003).
