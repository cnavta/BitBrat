# Retro – sprint-191-a7d2e3

## What worked
- Quick identification of the compilation error source (merge conflict).
- Restoring MCP handlers to registration methods correctly satisfied existing tests.
- Comprehensive project analysis provided a clear roadmap for open-sourcing.
- `validate_deliverable.sh` provided a reliable way to verify the project state.

## What didn’t
- The initial task had a severe syntax error that could have been avoided with better merge practices.
- Project lacks core open-source files (README, LICENSE), which makes it less approachable for new contributors.

## Next time
- Ensure all merge conflicts are resolved carefully and tests are run locally before pushing to main.
- Start implementing the high-priority documentation tasks from the backlog.
