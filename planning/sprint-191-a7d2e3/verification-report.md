# Deliverable Verification – sprint-191-a7d2e3

## Completed
- [x] Fix syntax errors in `src/common/mcp-server.ts`.
- [x] Analyze project and create open-source preparation backlog.
- [x] Create core open-source documentation (OS-002: README, LICENSE, etc.).
- [x] Update documentation with early development warnings (README, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [x] Successful build with `npm run build`.
- [x] Successful test execution with `npm test`.

## Partial
- None.

## Deferred
- Implementation of remaining backlog items (OS-003 to OS-006) is deferred to future sprints.

## Alignment Notes
- All core open-source files have been created in the root directory.
- Documentation now explicitly states that the project is in early development to manage user expectations.
- Backlog has been updated to mark OS-002 as done.
