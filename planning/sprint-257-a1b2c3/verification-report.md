# Deliverable Verification – sprint-257-a1b2c3

## Completed
- [x] Technical Architecture document for Tool Gateway (`technical-architecture.md`)
- [x] Execution Plan (`execution-plan.md`)
- [x] Trackable Prioritized YAML Backlog (`backlog.yaml`)
- [x] Implementation plan updated
- [x] Validation script updated (`validate_deliverable.sh`)

## Partial
- [ ] Publication PR not yet created (credentials required)

## Deferred
- [ ] Admin API details and OpenAPI spec (future sprint)
- [ ] Extraction of `McpClientManager`/`McpBridge` to shared module (implementation sprint)

## Alignment Notes
- Document aligns with `architecture.yaml` service entry for `tool-gateway`.
- RBAC, observability, and proxying requirements are captured with session-scoped MCP exposure.
