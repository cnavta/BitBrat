# Sprint Retro – sprint-239-a7b8c9

## What Worked
- Merging the CLI source from previous sprints ensured that the documentation updates are backed by working code in the same branch.
- The `brat setup` command significantly simplifies the onboarding experience.
- Interactive `brat chat` provides immediate value for testing the platform locally.

## What Didn't
- Some existing documentation files still had "non-goal" notes for implementation, which could be confusing for new developers.

## Future Improvements
- Consider moving all tool-specific documentation into a unified "Tools" section in the documentation portal.
- Add more examples to `brat chat` documentation (e.g., how to simulate different event types).
