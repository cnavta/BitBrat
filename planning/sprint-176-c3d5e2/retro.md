# Sprint Retro – sprint-176-c3d5e2

## What went well
- Rapid identification of the AI SDK version mismatch.
- Reproducing the schema serialization issue with local scripts.
- Defensive coding in `McpBridge` adds resilience against non-standard MCP server outputs.

## What could be improved
- The change in Sprint 175 was based on outdated or misread documentation/types for the AI SDK. Need to be more careful with SDK-specific field names across versions.

## Unresolved Items
- None.
