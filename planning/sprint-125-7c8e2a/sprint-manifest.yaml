notes: |
  Architectural planning sprint to extend command detection semantics:
  - Honor per-command `sigil` when set (unless `sigilOptional: true`).
  - Add `termLocation` matching (prefix | suffix | anywhere). Default to 'prefix' for legacy docs.
  - Enforce whitespace token boundaries so commands aren't matched when abutted to other text.
