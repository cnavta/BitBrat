objective: >-
  Define architecture and implement a first-pass llm-bot service using LangGraph.js
  to aggregate prompt annotations and call OpenAI (gpt-5-mini), append a candidate,
  and advance the routing slip.
scope:
  in:
    - llm-bot Technical Architecture
    - Minimal LangGraph-based LLM pipeline
    - Event consumption on internal.llmbot.v1
    - Prompt annotation extraction and combination
    - OpenAI call (gpt-5-mini)
    - Append response to candidates and call next()
    - Basic unit tests and validation script
  out:
    - Advanced prompt selection
    - RAG / tools / memory
    - Observability beyond basic logging
