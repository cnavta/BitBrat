owner: Cloud Architect
start: 2025-12-05T13:54:00-05:00
scope:
  - Investigate egress path for Cloud Run → Pub/Sub
  - Remove Cloud NAT from IaC if safe
  - Align Cloud Run egress posture to use most performant path
non_goals:
  - Production rollout of infra changes (apply) — plan-only in this sprint
  - Private Service Connect enablement for Google APIs
risks:
  - Services requiring fixed egress IP would be impacted (currently N/A)
  - Hidden dependency on NAT for outbound to third-parties (none reported)
stakeholders:
  - Lead Architect
  - Lead Implementor
  - Quality Lead
