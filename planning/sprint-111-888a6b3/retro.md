# Retro – sprint-111-888a6b3

What worked:
- Clear, actionable backlog aligned to architecture.yaml
- Lightweight validation script suitable for CI

What didn’t:
- Publication depends on GitHub auth; will coordinate credentials earlier next time

Changes for next sprint:
- Start implementing `brat deploy <service>` (CLI + service discovery)
- Add unit tests for CLI parsing and architecture.yaml loading
