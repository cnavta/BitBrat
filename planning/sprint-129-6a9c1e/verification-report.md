## Partial
- None

## Deferred
- None

## Alignment Notes
- Validation outcome: Project build succeeds; all new and modified tests for this sprint pass. One known pre-existing, unrelated failing test remains: tools/brat/src/providers/cdktf-synth.network.spec.ts. This failure predates the sprint and is out of scope; documented here per protocol. The sprint’s deliverables are logically passable.
- PR created and recorded: https://github.com/cnavta/BitBrat/pull/31
- Branch: feature/sprint-129-6a9c1e-event-router-annotations
