# Sprint Retro – sprint-158-e4f5g6

## What went well
- Fast identification of the redundancy root cause.
- Seamless merge of previous work into the current branch.
- Reproduction test confirmed the issue clearly.

## Challenges
- Missing dependencies in the environment (needed `npm install`) caused temporary test failures during validation.

## Next Steps
- Monitor LLM responses to see if the removal of the current turn from history improves instruction following or reduces confusion.
