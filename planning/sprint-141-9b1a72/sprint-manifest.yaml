notes: |
  Assumptions:
  - New sprint per user direction
  - Users are unique per ingress source (twitch/discord/etc)
  - 24h inactivity defines a new session
  - Use and extend the existing model (EnvelopeV1.user.notes, EnvelopeV1.user.tags)
  - No special compliance constraints for notes at this time
