title: Firestore-backed JsonLogic Routing for event-router
objective: >
  Design the technical architecture to add a Firestore-backed, JsonLogic-based
  routing system to the event-router service. The router will evaluate incoming
  events against prioritized rules and apply a RoutingSlip accordingly, falling
  back to a configured default when no rules match, then advance the event to
  the first destination.
