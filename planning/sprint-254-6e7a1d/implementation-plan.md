# Implementation Plan - sprint-254-6e7a1d

## Objective
Analyze the Graph + Mutation Event model and define a standardized implementation for state-based memory within the BitBrat Platform.

## Scope
- Analysis of `documentation/llm_graph_mutation_architecture.md`.
- Mapping components to BitBrat services and infrastructure.
- Creation of a new TA document: `documentation/bitbrat_state_memory_architecture.md`.
- Defining the first use case: Stream State management triggered by Twitch EventSub.

## Deliverables
- `documentation/bitbrat_state_memory_architecture.md`
- `planning/sprint-254-6e7a1d/verification-report.md`
- `planning/sprint-254-6e7a1d/retro.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- TA document is created and follows the Graph + Mutation Event model.
- TA document is specifically tailored to BitBrat Platform (GCP, NATS, Node/TS).
- TA document defines State Snapshot, Mutation Log, Rule Engine, and LLM Tools.

## Testing Strategy
- Not applicable for this documentation-only task. Validation will involve structure and link checks.

## Definition of Done
- TA document created and approved (self-verified against requirements).
- Sprint artifacts (manifest, log, plan, report, retro) completed.
- Pull Request created.
