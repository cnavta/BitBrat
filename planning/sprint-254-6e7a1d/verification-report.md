# Deliverable Verification – sprint-254-6e7a1d

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed `llm_graph_mutation_architecture.md`.
- [x] Mapped core components to BitBrat Platform (Firestore, NATS, MCP).
- [x] Created `documentation/bitbrat_state_memory_architecture.md` laying out the platform-specific architecture.
- [x] Defined the first use case (Stream State) in the TA document.

## Partial
- None

## Deferred
- Implementation of `state-engine` (planned for subsequent tasks in this or future sprints).
- Implementation of State MCP tools.

## Alignment Notes
- The architecture strictly follows the Graph + Mutation Event model as requested.
- Integration with existing BitBrat components (Firestore, NATS) is prioritized.
