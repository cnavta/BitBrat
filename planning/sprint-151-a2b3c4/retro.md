# Retro – sprint-151-a2b3c4

## What Worked
- Rapid research using the existing codebase and protocol.
- Clear mapping of platform properties to the internal user model.
- Identification of gaps in Discord mapping (need for role-based normalization).

## What Didn't
- Nothing significant; the documentation task was straightforward as the data already exists in the ingress payloads.

## Future Improvements
- Consider a unified "Entitlement Service" if platform-specific role mapping becomes more complex.
