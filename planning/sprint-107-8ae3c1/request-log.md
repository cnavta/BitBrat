  - backlog.md: added BB-IEV2 trackable items per service (ingress-egress, auth, router, command-processor) and cross-cutting tasks

## 2025-11-30T21:10:00Z
- Implemented InternalEventV2 end-to-end across active services:
  - Ingress (Twitch) now builds V1 then converts to V2 and publishes; sets egressDestination
  - Auth accepts V1/V2, enriches, emits V2 with routing step "auth"
  - Event Router accepts V1/V2, routes, emits V2 using attribute helper
  - Command Processor subscribes to INTERNAL_COMMAND_V1; normalizes to V2 and logs receipt (stub)
- Added/updated unit tests (ingress V2 publish, router V2 publish, command-processor subscriber, egress selection)
- Files modified include src/apps/*, src/services/ingress/twitch/*, src/common/events/adapters.ts, tests
