notes: |
  The previous attempts to fix the wildcard syntax (/oauth/* -> /oauth/(.*) -> /oauth/:path(.*)) still fail.
  According to path-to-regexp v8 documentation, the correct syntax for an unnamed wildcard is (.*) but Express might be wrapping it or using a specific version that expects something else, or maybe it just needs to be :path* or similar.
  Wait, if index 15 is where it fails:
  / o a u t h / : p a h ( . * )
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
  Index 15 is indeed the '('.
