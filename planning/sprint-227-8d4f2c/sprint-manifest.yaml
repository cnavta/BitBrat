  branch: "feature/sprint-227-8d4f2c-generic-egress"
notes: |
  Both ingress-egress and api-gateway services will listen to internal.egress.v1.
  Each service will determine if it supports the target platform and deliver the message.
  Undeliverable messages go to a DLQ for the persistence service.
