notes: |
  This sprint extends the command-processor so that commands can suggest a bot
  personality via CommandDoc.bot.personality. When present on a matched command,
  the processor should add an AnnotationV1 of kind "personality" with payload
  { name: <personality-name> } to the event for downstream LLM processing.
