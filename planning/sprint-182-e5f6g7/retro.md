# Retro – sprint-182-e5f6g7

## What worked
- The TA roadmap was clear enough to be decomposed into specific backlog items with minimal ambiguity.
- Using a dedicated planning sprint for the backlog ensures that implementation can proceed without architectural "discovery" interruptions.
- The use of `deps` in the YAML backlog clearly visualizes the implementation sequence (Webhook first, then Metadata, then Auth).

## What didn’t
- None.

## Next Steps
- Execute BL-TW-101 and BL-TW-102 in the next sprint to establish the core hybrid functionality.
- Coordinate with DevOps/Architecture to apply the `architecture.yaml` changes (BL-TW-103).
