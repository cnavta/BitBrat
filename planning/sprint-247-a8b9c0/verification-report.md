# Deliverable Verification – sprint-247-a8b9c0

## Completed
- [x] Analyze current architecture and phased flow requirements.
- [x] Create System Architecture document `documentation/architecture/system-architecture.md`.
- [x] Create Technical Architecture document `documentation/architecture/technical-architecture.md`.
- [x] Create and run `validate_deliverable.sh`.

## Partial
- None.

## Deferred
- None (Implementation of the architecture is out of scope for this sprint).

## Alignment Notes
- Documentation follows the instructions in the issue description, expanding on the 4-phase model (Ingress, Enrichment, Reaction, Egress).
- Technical approach suggests a Routing Slip pattern handled by the `event-router`.
