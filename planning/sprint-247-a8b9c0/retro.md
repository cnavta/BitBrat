# Retro – sprint-247-a8b9c0

## What Worked
- The 4-phase model (Ingress, Enrichment, Reaction, Egress) is a clear way to organize the platform's event flow.
- The Routing Slip pattern is a well-established way to handle dynamic orchestration in a decoupled pub/sub system.
- Documentation-only sprints are quick to validate and provide a strong foundation for future implementation.

## What Didn't Work
- Initial attempt to create multiple files/dirs via bash failed due to newline restrictions. Switched to `create` tool.

## Improvements for Next Sprint
- Continue to use specific tools for file creation to avoid shell-related errors.
