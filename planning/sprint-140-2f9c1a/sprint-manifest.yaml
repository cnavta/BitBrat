notes: |
  Sprint initiated to generalize OAuth support beyond Twitch. First provider addition is Discord. Discord
  gateway uses bot token (not code grant), so we will store bot token in token store and enable Discord
  ingress to source credentials from there with a safe fallback to env token during rollout.
  
  Force Completion accepted by user. Validation script and PR publication are documented in verification-report.md
  and publication.yaml for follow-up next sprint.
