# Sprint Retro – sprint-114-6ab39c

## What worked
- Clear identification of the canonical BaseServer subclass pattern
- Prioritized backlog that maps directly to generator functions and tests

## What didn’t
- None yet; implementation pending approval

## Next time
- Consider generating example resource usage toggles as flags (e.g., --with-pubsub)
