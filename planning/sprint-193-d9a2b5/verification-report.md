# Deliverable Verification – sprint-193-d9a2b5

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed `brat` tool source code and CLI help output.
- [x] Updated `README.md` with a new "Management CLI (brat)" section.
- [x] Documented all major `brat` commands: `doctor`, `config`, `service bootstrap`, `deploy`, `infra`, `lb`, `apis`, `cloud-run shutdown`, and `trigger`.
- [x] Verified `brat` related tests pass.
- [x] Verified `brat --help` output matches documented commands.

## Partial
- None.

## Deferred
- None.

## Alignment Notes
- Documentation was added to the root `README.md` as requested, providing a central place for developers to understand the primary management tool.
- The `validate_deliverable.sh` script was reviewed and found to already cover `brat` command executions.
