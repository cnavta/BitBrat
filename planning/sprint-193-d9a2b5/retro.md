# Retro – sprint-193-d9a2b5

## What worked
- The `brat` tool's built-in help was a good source of truth.
- The microservices architecture made it clear which commands belong to which domain.
- Existing `validate_deliverable.sh` provided a good reference for how `brat` is intended to be used in CI.

## What didn’t
- Initial search for `brat` source code was slightly confused by the `dist` path in `package.json`, but was quickly resolved by exploring the root directory.

## Summary
The sprint successfully documented the primary administration tool for the platform, which was previously undocumented in the root `README.md`.
