title: "Reliability Fixes – Pub/Sub duplicates, idempotency, sane defaults"
created: "2025-12-04T17:57:00-05:00"
owner: lead-implementor
objective: |
  Create a trackable, verifiable backlog to remediate duplicate message explosions
  and excessive retry behavior by:
  - Removing aggressive local publish timeouts (default to disabled)
  - Filtering retries to true transport errors only
  - Introducing idempotency keys end-to-end and lightweight subscriber dedupe
  - Tuning default Pub/Sub batching for low latency without being aggressive
  - Improving telemetry (attempt counts, durations) and documentation
scope:
  in:
    - Planning artifacts for the above fixes and updates
    - Validation script for planning deliverable (no external side effects)
    - Publication (feature branch + PR)
  out:
    - Runtime changes merged to main (to be delivered in follow-on sprint)
    - Cloud migrations or incremental releases (services are down)
acceptance_criteria:
  - Implementation plan exists with actionable, traceable backlog items
  - Validation script is logically passable on CI/local (build + tests)
  - PR opened with planning artifacts
