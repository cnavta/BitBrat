objective: "Lay out the technical architecture for CDKTF network stack (VPC, subnets, NAT/Router) and Load Balancer (front-end, URL map, backend services) for the brat (BitBrat Rapid Administration Tool)."
scope:
  - CDKTF Network Stack design (VPC, subnets, Cloud Router, Cloud NAT, firewall baseline)
  - CDKTF Load Balancer design (Global External Managed HTTP(S), URL map strategy, backend services)
  - URL Map advanced configuration approach using YAML-first workflow
  - Integration boundaries with architecture.yaml and brat CLI (future automation)
deliverables:
  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/network-and-lb-technical-architecture.md
  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/implementation-plan.md
  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/network-lb-implementation-plan.md

  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/verification-report.md
  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/retro.md
  - planning/sprint-6-d7e4b0/publication.yaml
acceptance_criteria:
  - Comprehensive technical architecture document aligning to architecture.yaml
  - Clear mapping from architecture.yaml services to URL map backends/routes
  - Documented CDKTF stack boundaries, inputs/outputs, and deployment flow
  - Validation script exists and passes locally
dependencies:
  - GCP project and APIs (Compute, Cloud Run, Artifact Registry) — for implementation phase
  - architecture.yaml — canonical service definitions
status: completed
notes:
  - This sprint starts the IaC design; implementation will begin in subsequent phases.
