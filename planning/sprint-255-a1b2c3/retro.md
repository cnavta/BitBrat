# Retro – sprint-255-a1b2c3

## What Worked
- **Clear Implementation Plan**: The plan was focused and the user approved it quickly.
- **Documentation-as-Code**: Using Markdown and Mermaid diagrams made the documentation easy to integrate into the repository.
- **Protocol Adherence**: Following the LLM Sprint Protocol v2.5 ensured that all necessary artifacts were created and the PR was handled correctly.

## What Didn't Work
- **Terminal Constraint**: Running multiple bash commands in one go caused several errors; had to break them down into separate steps.

## Future Improvement
- Consider automated Mermaid diagram generation or linting if the documentation becomes more complex.
- Explore ways to keep documentation in sync with code automatically (e.g., using JSDoc to generate parts of the overview).
