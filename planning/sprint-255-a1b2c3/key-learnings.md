# Key Learnings – sprint-255-a1b2c3

- **JSON-Logic for Reactive Rules**: It's a powerful and declarative way to define platform behavior without writing new code for every automation. Documenting it with clear examples is critical for adoption.
- **Graph + Mutation Model**: This model is essential for maintaining consistency across a distributed system like the BitBrat Platform. Understanding optimistic concurrency is key for all developers and agents.
- **MCP for State Access**: Standardizing all state access (even for internal services) via MCP tools makes the platform easier to reason about and simplifies agent development.
