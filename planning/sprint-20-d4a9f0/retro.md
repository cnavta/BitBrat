Sprint 20 — Retrospective (sprint-20-d4a9f0)

What went well
- Clear scoping: Kept implementation limited to schema and validation; avoided scope creep into synth/import.
- Fast feedback: Added focused Jest tests which provided immediate confidence and guided refinements.
- Backwards compatibility: Implemented deprecation warning without breaking existing lb.services[] users.

What could be improved
- Earlier alignment on JSDoc depth could have reduced rework time; add a checklist for schema docs in future sprints.
- Publication workflow automation (branch/PR) could be scripted to reduce manual steps.

Actions
- Add a test utility to generate sample architecture fixtures to reduce duplication across suites.
- Document assets-proxy expectations ahead of Sprint 22/23 to smooth adoption.
