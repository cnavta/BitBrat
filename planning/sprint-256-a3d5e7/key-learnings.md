- Decouple complex logic from MCP handlers into standalone, testable services (e.g., `RuleMapper`).
- Use Zod schemas in `registerTool` to benefit from automatic type-safe validation and JSON Schema generation.
- SSE testing remains a manual or complex process with the current MCP SDK; prefer unit tests for logic and simple mocks for tool registration.
