# Sprint 7 Retro — CDKTF Scaffolding and CI Wiring (Plan-only)

Sprint ID: sprint-7-a13b2f
Date: 2025-11-13
Owner: Lead Implementor
Source of truth: architecture.yaml

## Goal
Produce an implementation plan for CDKTF scaffolding and CI dry-run wiring (plan-only) without creating any infrastructure resources.

## What went well
- Clear, actionable implementation plan created with explicit DoD and AC aligned to architecture.yaml.
- Verification report added prior to closure to ensure parity with the plan-only scope.
- Validation script enforces presence of critical planning artifacts and passes locally.
- Traceability maintained via request-log and publication.yaml links.

## What could be improved
- Publication PR could not be created in this environment; the compare link is provided and publication is marked as deferred pending repository permissions.
- Earlier alignment with PR publication constraints would streamline closure.

## Outcome
- Plan approved and documented.
- No infra or runtime code merged (by design).
- Publication set to deferred with compare link present; will be created at next opportunity.

## Action items
1. Create PR on branch feature/sprint-7-a13b2f and update publication.yaml with live PR URL and status. 
2. Upon PR review, update planning/index.md publication status and link.
3. Carry forward any lessons about PR permissions and external steps into Sprint 8 execution planning.
