# Deliverable Verification Report — Sprint 7 (sprint-7-a13b2f)

- Source of truth: architecture.yaml
- Sprint objective: CDKTF Scaffolding and CI Wiring (Plan-only)
- Report date: 2025-11-13T09:20:00Z
- Approved by: chris.navta

## Completed as Implemented
- [x] implementation-plan.md — Detailed plan for CDKTF scaffolding and CI dry-run wiring.
- [x] sprint-manifest.yaml — Includes scope, AC, dependencies, and approval metadata.
- [x] request-log.md — Contains initialization entry and approval entry.
- [x] validate_deliverable.sh — Plan-only validation script; passes locally.
- [x] publication.yaml — PR metadata stub aligned with Sprint Protocol; links to sprint docs.

## Partial or Deferred Items
- [ ] Publication (Pull Request) — Deferred until branch is opened; current link is compare view. Will be updated to the live PR URL and status when created.
- [ ] Implementation of CDKTF scaffolding and CI wiring — Deferred to Sprint 8 per plan; no resources created in this sprint by design.

## Additional Observations
- All deliverables conform to the LLM Sprint Protocol v2.2 and the project guidelines; no runtime or IaC changes were made.
- Validation script intentionally checks presence of plan-only artifacts; verification added here prior to sprint close.
- Next actions before closure: create/open PR and update publication.yaml with real PR URL and status; upon user signal "Sprint complete.", generate retro.md and update key-learnings.md, then mark sprint completed in sprint-manifest.yaml.
