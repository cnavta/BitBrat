objective: "CDKTF Scaffolding and CI Wiring (Plan-only)"
scope:
  - Produce a detailed implementation plan for establishing CDKTF project scaffolding for network and load balancer stacks without creating resources
  - Define brat CLI wiring (plan-only) for `brat infra plan|apply network|lb` delegating to Terraform adapter (synth only this sprint)
  - Define CI (Cloud Build) additions to run dry-run planning on PRs
  - Document acceptance criteria, testing strategy, and DoD aligned with Sprint Protocol v2.2
