# Deliverable Verification – sprint-181-f2e3d4

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed the Twilio Hybrid Approach (WebSocket + REST).
- [x] Created `technical-architecture.md` detailing the design, sequence flow, and implementation steps.
- [x] Identified necessary components and configuration changes.

## Partial
- None

## Deferred
- Implementation (Phase 1-5) is deferred to a future implementation-focused sprint.

## Alignment Notes
- The proposed architecture aligns with the hybrid approach suggested in the guidance.
- It leverages existing project infrastructure (`BaseServer` for HTTP, `ingress-egress` for Twilio logic).
