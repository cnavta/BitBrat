  branch: "feature/sprint-253-a2b3c4-realign-event-destinations"
notes: |
  Following updated architecture.yaml:
  - auth: consumes internal.auth.v1, no longer publishes internal.user.enriched.v1
  - event-router: consumes internal.ingress.v1 and internal.enriched.v1, no longer publishes internal.llmbot.v1
  - query-analyzer: moved in architecture.yaml but configuration remains the same.
